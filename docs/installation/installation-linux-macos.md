!!! tip "Give it a moment"

## Apple Silicon: MLX models

If you are on an M-series Mac, the **Parakeet MLX** and **Whisper MLX** models will be available in [Transcription Settings](../reference/transcription.md#services). These use hardware acceleration on Apple Silicon and run noticeably faster than the CPU variants.

Intelligent chapter detection is not available in a native macOS install. To use it on a Mac, run Achew through [Docker](installation-docker.md).
